    },
    {

      a: "We process orders rapidly to ensure prompt delivery. If you need to make changes or cancel, please contact us within 2 hours of placing your order at hello@zaevyul.com or via WhatsApp.",
    },
    {
      q: "Will I have to pay import duties or customs charges?",
      a: "For domestic orders within India, all taxes (including 18% GST) are included. For international shipments, local customs duties or import taxes may apply depending on your country's regulations and are paid directly to the courier upon delivery.",
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if my package is delayed or lost in transit?",
      a: "All Zaevyul shipments are fully insured against transit loss or damage. If your shipment experiences an unusual delay, our customer support team will actively coordinate with the carrier to resolve it or dispatch an immediate replacement.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you offer gift wrapping and personalized notes?",
      a: "Yes! Every Zaevyul piece is delivered in our signature gift box. You can also request a complimentary hand-written gift message at checkout under the order notes section.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I ship to a PO Box address?",
      a: "Because our shipments require a physical signature upon delivery for security, we recommend providing a residential or business address rather than a PO Box.",
    },
  ],

  "product-care": [
    {
      q: "Are your products 100% authentic Kashmir Pashmina?",
      a: "Yes. Every Zaevyul shawl and stole is crafted from 100% pure Ladakhi Pashmina wool sourced from Changthangi goats, hand-spun and hand-woven by master artisans in Kashmir. Each piece carries an authenticity certificate.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I care for and wash my pashmina?",
      a: "We strongly recommend professional dry cleaning to preserve the delicate fibers. For gentle home care, hand wash carefully in lukewarm water using a mild wool detergent, never wring, and lay flat to dry in shade.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I store my Pashmina during off-seasons?",
      a: "Store your clean Pashmina in a breathable cotton or linen bag in a cool, dry place. Avoid sealed plastic bags, and place natural cedarwood blocks or lavender sachets inside to prevent moth damage.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between Pashmina and Cashmere?",
      a: "Pashmina is a premium grade of fine cashmere produced exclusively by the Capra Hircus goats living at altitudes over 14,000 feet in Ladakh. Pashmina fibers are finer (12–15 microns) and warmer than standard commercial cashmere.",
    },
    {
      q: "What are the dimensions of your shawls, stoles, and scarves?",
      a: 'Our standard sizes are: Shawls (100 cm x 200 cm / 40" x 80"), Stoles (70 cm x 200 cm / 28" x 80"), and Scarves (35 cm x 180 cm / 14" x 70"). Handcrafted dimensions may vary slightly by 1–2 cm.',
    },
    {
      q: "What is Sozni Embroidery and Kani Weaving?",
      a: "Sozni is an intricate needle embroidery unique to Kashmir executed with fine silk threads. Kani weaving uses small wooden bobbins (kanis) to weave elaborate floral patterns directly into the fabric on traditional wooden looms.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does Pashmina pill or shed fibers?",
      a: "Pure hand-spun Pashmina contains natural fine fibers that may experience minor pilling initially due to friction. Pilling can be gently removed using a garment comb and decreases naturally with wear.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why is hand-woven Pashmina light or semi-sheer?",
      a: "Pure Pashmina fibers are incredibly fine and light yet possess remarkable thermal insulation properties. A true Pashmina shawl provides extreme warmth without being heavy or bulky.",
    },
    {
      q: "How can I test the purity of my Pashmina at home?",
      a: "Pure Pashmina passes the ring test (slides smoothly through a finger ring), has a subtle natural sheen without synthetic gloss, and produces an organic burnt hair smell if a loose thread fringe is burned.",
    },
  ],

  "returns-exchanges": [
    {
      q: "What is your return policy?",
      a: "We accept returns within 14 days of delivery for all unused, unwashed items in original condition with tags and gift packaging intact. Once inspected, refunds are processed to your original payment method.",
    },

      q: "Can I exchange my order?",
